# Sudoku-solver
Sudoku is a logic puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits in such a way such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that make up the larger 9×9 grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

## Backtracking technique
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
